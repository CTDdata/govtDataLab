Choose a pubicly available dataset from a government entity. Use raw data/micro data, not data that has already been summarized.
Try to find a dataset  that's particulary interesting to you.

Here are some sources of government data:

United States Census

Federal Reserve

Navigating these data can be tricky, and is also part of a data scientist's job.
Modify today's code-along to incorporate your chosen data set, and create a frequency chart.
Explain why you chose this dataset, and in particular, this variable to analyze. Write about what you've discovered.
Write about the potential limitations of the dataset you've chosen.
